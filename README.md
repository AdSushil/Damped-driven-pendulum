# Damped-driven-pendulum
This repository includes Python codes for studying the Chaotic behavior of damped driven pendulum. For this different dynamical
properties like Phase space, Poincare section and lyapunov exponent are studied. Also the simulation of damped driven pendulum has been included here.
